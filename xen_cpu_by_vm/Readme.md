Check_MK check for XEN (NOT XenServer)

This check uses the xl Command and extracts CPU Usage by VM with Performance data.

- xl Command must be present on XEN Host
- Copy Agent file to /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins/
- Copy Server check file to /usr/share/check_mk/checks/
- Do inventory and have fun


This is my first Check_MK Plugin and very basic.
